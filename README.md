# TravelTide-Mastery-Project
This project is about TravelTide customer data, that has to be segmented according to business needs and deliver data-driven recommendations based on your findings.

# Introduction
E-booking startup TravelTide is a new player in the online travel industry. It has experienced steady growth since it was founded at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic (2021-04) on the strength of its data aggregation and search technology, which is best in class. Certain aspects of the TravelTide customer experience are underdeveloped, resulting in poor customer retention. Now a marketing campaign should be designed and executed with personalized rewards program that keeps customers returning to the TravelTide platform. 
5 different perks have to be assigned to customers:
 - Free hotel meal
 - free checked bag
 - no cancellation fees
 - exclusive discounts
 - 1 night free hotel with flight

# Planning

**Workflow for assigning an individualized perk**

**1. Identification of active users**
Users with more than 7 sessions since January 4, 2023 
Reduction of user data from more than 5 million to 5998

**2. Segmentation of customers into groups**
After analysis: 10 groups have been built
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b9a328a-8afb-4baf-930a-c9c3d0ae8e73)
Others include all travelers who could not be assigned to a specific group
Metrics used for building the groups: session behaviour, trip behaviour, demographics


**3. Data exploration and finding groups which can be assigned for a perk**

**Rule Set for User Group Creation**


*segments used:*
|Segment | Characteristic|
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Age Group | 16-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+ |
|Travel Frequency | frequent traveler (>= 5 bookings), casual traveler (2-4 bookings), low-frequent traveller (1 booking) |
|Spend | High spender (total cost > 7000 USD|
|Flight Distance | short-haul-flyer (avg < 500 miles), medium-haul-flyer (avg 500-2500 miles), long-haul-flyer (avg > 2500 miles) |
|Booking Time | Last minute booker (< 7 days), Early booker (7-60 days), Moderate early booker (60-180 days), Super early booker (> 180 days) |
|Cancellation| Same-Day Cancellers, Last-Minute Cancellers (1-7 days), Moderate Cancellers (8-30 days), Early Cancellers (30+ days), No Cancellation|
|Travel Party | Solo traveler, Family/Group taveler, Solo and group traveler |
|Family | married, children, not married, children, married, no children, not married, no children|
 
**4. Additional Calculations and data changes**
   - re-calculation of the nights spent in a hotel without taking into consideration the time
     NULL values only for cancellation sessions nd hotel_booked = false
   - age: calculated base on birthdate and session_end
   - time_since_signup: calculated as difference between sign_up_date and session_end
   - duration_stay: calculated in hours either from return_time and departure_time or check_in_time and check_out_time
   - add cancellation data to appropriate session_id
   - avg_days_to_cancellation using session_end of cancelled session and session_start
   - avg_session_duration: difference of session_end and session_start
   - cost_flight: using base_fare_usd taking into consideration seats and flight_discount_amount
   - cost_hotel: using hotel_per_room_usd taking into consideration nights and hotel_discount_amount
   - avg_days_to_travel: difference of flight departure ot hotel check_in and session_end
   - travel_party: 100 --> group/family
                     1 --> solo
   - avg_distance_miles using longitude and latitude information of home and destination airport and applying the Harvesine formula

 **5. Decision Tree and Customer Group Assignment**

**6. Perk Assignment**
| Customer Group | Perk | Why It Matters |
|---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------|
|Mile Master (Long distance, frequent flyer) | Free Checked Bag | Encourages ongoing loyalty and reduces booking friction.|
|High Spenders (> 7000 USD on total trips) | Free Checked Bags, Hotel Nights with Flight | Reinforces a premium experience without appearing cheap|
|Spontaneous Globetrotter (Frequent Flyer, Last-Minute Booker)| No Cancellation Fees | Provides flexibility for spontaneous travelers|
|Jet Sprint Nomad (Frequent Flyer, Early Booker) | Real-Time Deals, Flexibility | Inzentivizes advance planning |
|Group Traveler | Free Meals, Group Discounts | Larger groups appreciate accomodation perks |
|Family Traveler (Traveler has Children) | Free Meals, Group Discounts | Helps with family budgeting and convenience |
|Senior Traveler (age >=65)| No Cancellation Fees | Older travelers value flexibility|
|Adaptive Explorer (Frequent Flyer, Last-Minute Cancellations)| No Cancellation Fees | Supports Flexibility|
|Next-Gen Wanderer (age 16-24) | Free Hotel Meal | Young Travelers are Price Sensitive|
|Business Traveler (Middle-Aged, Solo Traveler) | No Cancellation Fees | Business travelers value flexibility|
