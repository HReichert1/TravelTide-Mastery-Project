# TravelTide-Mastery-Project
This project is about TravelTide customer data, that has to be segmented according to business needs and deliver data-driven recommendations based on your findings.

# Introduction
E-booking startup TravelTide is a new player in the online travel industry. It has experienced steady growth since it was founded at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic (2021-04) on the strength of its data aggregation and search technology, which is best in class. Certain aspects of the TravelTide customer experience are underdeveloped, resulting in poor customer retention. Now a marketing campaign should be designed and executed with personalized rewards program that keeps customers returning to the TravelTide platform. 
5 different perks have to be assigned to customers:
 - Free hotel meal
 - free checked bag
 - no cncellation fees
 - exclusive discounts
 - 1 night free hotel with flight
